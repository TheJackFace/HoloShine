# HoloShine
A small chain reaction game made for Looking Glass Portrait and a LeapMotion sensor. Windows build made in Unity 2019.4.

The green ball grows and then dies. All balls it touches while growing also start to grow. Make as many balls grow als possible. Move the green ball with one of your open hands. Place the ball by making a pinch gesture. It will then start to grow and make all other balls it touches grow as well.

I have not been able to properly configure Looking Glass builds. On my machine, I have to move the app window to the Looking Glass display (which is my right display) by pressing 'Alt + Shift + RightArrow'.

Also, the image is very blurry outside of the focal plain, much more so than when I run the game from the Unity Editor.
